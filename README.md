- **Material 3 Design**: Modern, clean interface with dynamic color support

## Requirements

  - Home Assistant instance running on your network
  - Fire TV with ADB debugging enabled
  - Android TV integration configured in Home Assistant

## Automatic Roku Discovery

UniRemote can automatically find Roku devices on your Wi-Fi network using SSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol).

- Tap the **Scan for Roku** button in Settings (next to the Roku IP field).
- The app sends a multicast SSDP M-SEARCH to `239.255.255.250:1900` and listens for Roku responses.
- All discovered Roku devices are shown in a list with their name, model, and IP address.
- Tap a device to save its IP instantly‚Äîno manual typing required!

**Requirements:**
- Your phone and Roku TV must be on the same Wi-Fi network.
- The app requests the `CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE` permission to receive SSDP responses.
- Some Wi-Fi networks (especially guest or enterprise) may block device-to-device discovery.

**How it works:**
- UniRemote acquires a Wi-Fi MulticastLock during the scan (released automatically).
- It sends a discovery packet and waits up to 3 seconds for responses.
- For each Roku found, it fetches device info (name/model) for easy identification.
- If no devices are found, you'll see a helpful message and troubleshooting hints.

**Privacy:**
- Discovery is local-only and does not send any data outside your network.

**Troubleshooting:**
- Make sure your phone's Wi-Fi is ON and connected to the same network as your Roku TV.
- Ensure your Roku TV is powered on and connected to Wi-Fi.
- If no devices are found, try again or check your router's settings for client isolation.

## Using the App

UniRemote supports **dual-mode operation**: control either your Roku TV or Fire TV with a simple toggle. Volume and Power buttons **always** control the Roku TV, so they work even when viewing Fire TV content.

### Setting up Roku TV Control

1. **Find your Roku TV's IP address**:
   - On your Roku TV: Settings ‚Üí Network ‚Üí About
   - Look for the "IP address" field (e.g., 192.168.1.100)

2. **Configure UniRemote**:
   - Tap the Settings icon (‚öôÔ∏è) in the top-right corner
   - Enter the Roku IP address
   - Tap "Validate Roku Connection" to test
   - Tap "Save All Settings"

3. **Use the remote**:
   - Select "Roku TV" mode at the top
   - D-pad for navigation
   - OK button to select
   - Home/Back for navigation
   - Play/Pause for media control
   - Volume and Power always control Roku TV

**Network Security Note:**
- Roku's External Control Protocol (ECP) uses unencrypted HTTP on port 8060.
- **Debug builds allow cleartext (HTTP) globally via network_security_config. Release builds remain HTTPS-only.**
- All Roku communication stays within your local network and never leaves your home.

### Fire TV (Amazon Fling SDK)

Control Fire TV directly over Wi‚ÄëFi using the Amazon Fling SDK (no Home Assistant or ADB required).

Prerequisites:
- Your phone and Fire TV are on the same Wi‚ÄëFi
- Developer options ‚Üí ADB debugging may be needed for some devices to advertise on the network

Steps:
1. Tap the Settings icon (‚öôÔ∏è)
2. In the "Fire TV (Fling SDK)" card, tap "Scan for Fire TV"
3. Select your Fire TV from the list; this saves its receiver ID
4. Switch the mode toggle to "Fire TV"
5. Play/Pause/Stop actions work locally via Fling; no Home Assistant or ADB needed

Notes:
- Navigation keys (Home/Back/D‚Äëpad) are not exposed by the Fling media controller; they typically require ADB. The app will show a helpful message if you try them in Fire TV mode.
- Volume and Power continue to control Roku to keep TV control consistent.

Support note:
- Amazon has announced end of standard support for the Fling SDK on March 5, 2026. As a forward‚Äëlooking path, consider implementing Matter Casting. See Amazon‚Äôs Fling discontinuation & Matter Casting replacement announcement.

If you prefer full navigation for Fire TV, use the Home Assistant method below or the official Fire TV Remote app.

### Setting up Fire TV Control via Home Assistant

Fire TV control works through [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) using the Android TV integration. This allows network-based control without requiring your phone to pair directly with the Fire TV.

#### Prerequisites
- Home Assistant installed and running on your network
- Fire TV connected to the same network
- Home Assistant accessible via local IP or hostname

#### Step 1: Enable ADB on Fire TV

1. On your Fire TV: **Settings** ‚Üí **My Fire TV** ‚Üí **Developer Options**
2. Turn ON **ADB Debugging**
3. Turn ON **Apps from Unknown Sources** (if needed)
4. Note your Fire TV's IP address (Settings ‚Üí My Fire TV ‚Üí About ‚Üí Network)

#### Step 2: Add Fire TV to Home Assistant

1. In Home Assistant web interface: **Settings** ‚Üí **Devices & Services**
2. Click **"+ ADD INTEGRATION"**
3. Search for and select **"Android TV"** or **"Android TV / Fire TV"**
4. Select **"Android TV (network-based)"**
5. Enter your Fire TV's IP address
6. Complete the ADB pairing process (you may see an auth prompt on your TV)
7. Name your device (e.g., "Fire TV Living Room")
8. The integration will create a `media_player` entity (e.g., `media_player.fire_tv_living_room`)

#### Step 3: Create a Home Assistant Long-Lived Access Token

1. In Home Assistant: Click your profile (bottom-left avatar)
2. Scroll down to **"Long-Lived Access Tokens"**
3. Click **"CREATE TOKEN"**
4. Give it a name (e.g., "UniRemote App")
5. Copy the token (it starts with `eyJ...`) - you won't be able to see it again!

#### Step 4: Configure UniRemote

1. In UniRemote, tap the Settings icon (‚öôÔ∏è)
2. Under **Home Assistant Settings**, enter:
   - **Home Assistant URL**: Your HA instance URL (e.g., `http://192.168.1.50:8123` or `https://homeassistant.local:8123`)
   - **Long-Lived Access Token**: Paste the token from Step 3
   - **Fire TV Entity ID**: The entity ID from HA (e.g., `media_player.fire_tv_living_room`)
     - Find this in HA under Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí Android TV ‚Üí click your device
3. Tap **"Validate Home Assistant Connection"** to test
4. Tap **"Save All Settings"**

#### Step 5: Use Fire TV Mode

1. Select **"Fire TV"** mode at the top of the app
2. Navigation (D-pad, Home, Back, Play, Pause) will control Fire TV via Home Assistant
3. **Volume and Power continue to control your Roku TV** for unified TV control

### How It Works

- **Roku Mode**: All commands sent directly to Roku via HTTP (ECP protocol)
- **Fire TV Mode**: Navigation commands routed through Home Assistant's Android TV integration
- **Volume & Power**: Always sent to Roku TV, regardless of mode - this ensures your TV's physical controls work even when using HDMI input from Fire TV

### Troubleshooting Fire TV

**"Fire TV command failed"**
- Verify Home Assistant is reachable from your phone
- Check Fire TV entity ID is correct in settings
- Ensure ADB Debugging is still enabled on Fire TV
- In Home Assistant, check the Android TV integration is "Connected"
- Try restarting the Android TV integration in Home Assistant

**Fire TV stops responding**
- Fire TV may disable ADB after updates or reboots
- Re-enable Developer Options ‚Üí ADB Debugging on Fire TV
- Restart the Android TV integration in Home Assistant

**Want to test HA connection manually**
- Use the "Validate Home Assistant Connection" button in Settings
- Check Home Assistant logs for any error messages

### Using the Official Fire TV Remote App (Legacy)

Tap "Open Fire TV Remote" to:
- Launch the official Fire TV Remote app if installed
- Open the Play Store to install it if not found
- Fall back to browser if Play Store is unavailable

## Network Configuration

The app uses HTTP (cleartext traffic) to communicate with Roku devices. This is configured securely:

- **Debug builds only**: Cleartext traffic is permitted for private IP ranges
- **Production builds**: No cleartext traffic allowed
- **Private networks only**: Only 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16 ranges
